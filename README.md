# UIFrameWork
A tiny and powerful UIFrameWork for Unity4.x and Unity5.x

**[中文介绍](https://github.com/tinyantstudio/UIFrameWork/blob/master/ChineseReadMe.md)**

## How to Start

1. Click the **MainStart.scene** in Scenes folder
2. find GameObject **"!!!DemoDriver!!!"** in scene
3. Toggle the **DebugSystem Enable Log**
4. play the **"Game"** from one window to other window ,back to another window ......

## Attention
1. Unity4.x & NGUI3.6.7(If you want using Unity3d 5.x version, just update the NGUI's right version too)

## UIFrameWork Target:
1. load window, Show, hide, close window
2. Animation Interface for your window hide/show animation
3. Window Depth, window common collider bg manager
4. (!!!maybe the most goal)Manager your window navigation (when you click the return/back button you need not to care which window I should Go)
5. Add some very common MessageBox
6. Give you a total game example(just the window logic)
7. You can easily modify for your own game
8. Do more (event system , Decoupled your game code)


## Share and Idea
1. If you find some cool idea just share with us (new issues or email)
2. This framework is in **updating**


Wish this simple tiny frame work can help some one who want to save his time develop the window logic
